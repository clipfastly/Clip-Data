10.Given a bank customer, build a neural network-based classifier 
that can determine whether they will leave or not in the next 6 
months. Dataset Description: The case study is from an open-
source dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains 10,000 sample 
points with 14 distinct features such as CustomerId, CreditScore, 
Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, etc. Perform following 
steps: 
1. Read the dataset. 
2. Distinguish the feature and target set and divide the data set 
into training and test sets. 
3. Normalize the train and test data. 
4. Initialize and build the model. Identify the points of 
improvement and implement the same. 5. Print the accuracy 
score and confusion matrix (5 points)

# 1. Read the dataset
url = "C:/Users/palla/OneDrive/Desktop/Bank/Churn_Modelling.csv" # 
Local path to your dataset
dataset = pd.read_csv(url)
# 2. Check for missing values (optional)
print(dataset.isnull().sum()) # To check if there are any missing values
# 3. Handle categorical variables (Geography, Gender)
